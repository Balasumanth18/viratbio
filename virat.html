    <h3>Birth</h3>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath
    Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother,
    Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna. Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early
    education at Vishal Bharti Public School. According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as
    a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father to bowl to him.
    In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd espoused
    his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet
    Rajkumar Sharma. Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a
    professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully
    cricket. Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team,
    supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential
    clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into
    the under-15 Delhi team. He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the
    Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave. In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned
    to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.
    On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.During his childhood, his
    father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the one who drove
    him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at times.According to his
    mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took cricket with newfound seriousness,
    prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim
    Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.

    <h3>Education</h3>
    Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer who currently plays Test cricket and ODI cricket for India. Kohli
    is a former T20I player and a former captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed batsman and
    an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler. He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and
    Delhi in domestic cricket. He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in IPL, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI,
    and stands as the fourth-highest in international cricket. He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries
    in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Hence, Kohli is widely regarded
    as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and the greatest batsman in the modern era. Kohli was a key member of the
    Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and captained India to
    win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.
    In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of T20I
    rankings.[6] In 2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one
    spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the
    International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade.
    Kohli has garnered 10 ICC Awards which is more than any player in International Cricket, making him the most
    decorated player in International Cricket history. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four times in 2012,
    2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two
    occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC ODI and Test Player of
    the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive
    years, from 2016 to 2018. Kohli has the second most and most 'Player of the Match' and 'Player of the Series' awards
    to his name, respectively, in all three formats combined. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna
    Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna Award, in 2018. In 2018,
    Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.After winning the final of
    the 2024 T20 World Cup, Kohli announced his retirement from T20I
    </p>

    <h3>CRICKET</h3>
    Virat Kohli first stood in as captain in a 2013 three-country series in the West Indies when MS Dhoni, the Indian
    captain at that time, was injured, and continued to lead for the rest of the series. He subsequently led India in an
    ODI series against Zimbabwe when several senior players were rested. Kohli also captained India in the 2014 Asia Cup
    in Dhoni’s absence, scoring one hundred, but India failed to reach the final.
    Kohli has always been an aggressive batsman, and he showed this facet in his first Test captaincy, when Dhoni was
    injured before a match against Australia in Adelaide in 2014. Not content with a century in his captaincy debut in
    the first innings, Kohli showed he would not play for a draw as many past Indian captains had, scoring 141 in the
    second innings as India came close to chasing a challenging 364. After Dhoni returned for the second Test, Kohli
    took over again in the third with Dhoni injured again and scored a century and a fifty as India drew the Test. Dhoni
    retired after the match, leading to Kohli being announced as the official Test captain from the fourth match onward.
    Captaincy seemed to agree with Kohli in Tests, where he hit his first double century, against the West Indies in
    2016, followed by another double against New Zealand the same year, leading India to wins in both series. He hit
    double hundreds in his next two series against England and Bangladesh as well, becoming the first batsman to hit
    double centuries in four consecutive series.

    Kohli captained India at the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, but India lost to Pakistan in the final. Kohli scored two
    double centuries that year in a Test series against Sri Lanka. He continued to score ODI hundreds. On the 2018 tour
    to England, he rectified his poor run from the last England tour with a series of good scores, leading India to one
    win, but the team was defeated in close matches and lost the series 4–1. The same year Kohli became the 13th batsman
    to score 10,000 runs in ODIs, becoming the fastest to do so, in a full 54 innings fewer than Sachin Tendulkar had,
    previously the fastest.

    The crowning glory of his captaincy career came on the 2018–19 tour of Australia, when the Kohli-led India side won
    its first Test series in Australia. In the process Kohli scored his 25th Test hundred.

    Kohli was named captain of the Indian team for the ODI World Cup in 2019. He scored five fifties in the tournament,
    which many considered below expectations for a player of his caliber. India lost to New Zealand in the semifinals,
    but Kohli became the fastest to 20,000 international runs across formats during the tournament. In a Test series
    against South Africa later that year, he scored his highest Test score of 254 not out. He was an all-format captain
    by now. He led India to Australia on the 2020–21 tour but returned home for the birth of his daughter after India’s
    defeat in the first Test. He was unable to return to Australia because of COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions and
    watched from India as Ajinkya Rahane rallied an injury-hit Indian side to a 2–1 series victory.

    Kohli’s performance subsequently dipped across formats, and he was not to hit another century for a few years,
    though he continued to score several fifties. During this period, India lost to New Zealand in the final of the
    inaugural World Test Championship in 2021 and failed to qualify for the knockout round in the 2021 T20I World Cup.
    Kohli subsequently resigned from T20I and ODI captaincy, both positions being taken over by Rohit Sharma.

    In 2022 Kohli stepped down from Test captaincy, and Sharma took over. Kohli had captained India in a record 68
    Tests, winning 40 of them. He has been the most successful Indian captain by some distance with series wins both
    home and away, and his record compares favorably with great captains across eras.
    In 2008, Kohli was approached by sports agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sport and Entertainment after his notable
    performance in the ICC Under-19 World Cup. Sajdeh was impressed with Kohli's leadership skills and attitude and saw
    great potential in the young cricketer. After being recommended by Yuvraj Singh, Kohli was signed to Cornerstone
    Sport and Entertainment.[65] Over the years, Kohli's brand endorsement portfolio has experienced significant growth.
    In 2013, it was reported that his endorsements were valued at over ₹1 billion (US$12 million).[66] Now in 2023, his
    brand value has reached ₹1,000 crore (US$120 million).[67] His bat deal with MRF is regarded as one of the most
    financially rewarding deals in cricket history.[68] In 2017, Kohli entered into a notable endorsement agreement with
    Puma that spanned over eight years and was estimated to be worth around ₹1.1 billion (US$13 million). This deal made
    Kohli the first Indian athlete to sign a brand endorsement contract valued at ₹100 crore (equivalent to ₹140 crore
    or US$17 million in 2023) deal with a brand.[69] As of January 2023, Kohli is widely regarded as the most marketable
    cricketer, with annual earnings estimated at ₹165 crore (equivalent to ₹175 crore or US$21 million in 2023).[70]
    Kohli is currently recognized as the most followed Asian individual on the social media platform Instagram, boasting
    over 266 million followers on the platform. Reports indicate that he is able to command a fee of ₹8.9 crore
    (equivalent to ₹9.4 crore or US$1.1 million in 2023) for each sponsored post on the platform.
    Kohli has gained international acclaim for his athletic achievements and widespread popularity, earning a prominent
    place among the world's most renowned athletes, as per ESPN.[72][73] In 2014, American Appraisal conducted an
    evaluation of Kohli's brand value and determined it to be $56.4 million, placing him fourth on the list of India's
    most valued celebrity brands.[74] The following two years saw Kohli's brand value soar higher. As per a report
    published in October 2016 by Duff & Phelps, Kohli's brand worth had increased to $92 million, second only to that of
    Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan.[75] In 2017, Kohli was recognized by Forbes as the seventh "Most Valuable Brand
    among Athletes", surpassing renowned sports figures such as Lionel Messi, Rory McIlroy, and Stephen Curry, with a
    brand estimation of $14.5 million.[76] By September of the same year, Kohli had amassed endorsement agreements with
    17 distinct brands, and he announced that he would only endorse products that he personally uses and believes
    in.[77] The following year, he was featured on Time magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the
    world.[78] In 2019, Kohli was the only cricketer included in Forbes' list of "World's 100 Highest-Paid Athletes". He
    was ranked 100th on the list, with earnings estimated at $25 million, with $21 million being procured through
    endorsements, and the remainder from salary and tournament winnings.[79] Furthermore, in March 2019, Kohli was named
    the brand ambassador of the mobile esports platform, Mobile Premier League.[80] Kohli's earning potential continued
    to climb, and in 2020, he attained the 66th spot in Forbes compilation of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the
    world for the year 2020, with estimated earnings exceeding $26 million.[81] In April 2021, Vivo appointed Kohli as
    their brand ambassador ahead of the Indian Premier League.

    <h3>Acheviment</h3>
    Kohli received the Arjuna Award, India’s second highest sporting honor, from the government of India in 2013. In
    2017 Kohli garnered the Padma Shri, India’s fourth highest civilian award. In 2018 he received the Rajiv Gandhi Khel
    Ratna Award (now the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award), India’s highest sporting honor. A stand at the Arun
    Jaitley Stadium in Delhi was renamed after Kohli in 2019.
    Kohli holds a prominent place in the annals of Indian cricket. He has the distinction of being the only cricketer to
    have been named the Player of the Tournament in the T20 World Cup on two separate occasions, in 2014 and 2016.[130]
    In terms of ODI centuries, he ranks first with 50.[131] He surpassed Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 49 ODI tons and
    achieved this feat on 15 November 2023 in the semifinal of the 2023 Cricket World Cup, while also becoming the first
    player to score more than 700 runs in a single edition of the tournament.[132] Furthermore, in international
    cricket, Kohli has amassed 80 centuries, second only to Sachin Tendulkar's 100 centuries.[133] In 2018, Kohli set a
    record, becoming the first player to score 1,000 ODI runs in 11 innings in a calendar year.[134] In 2022, he
    achieved another milestone by scoring 1,000 runs in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, becoming the second player to reach
    this feat after Mahela Jayawardene.[135] During the match against Bangladesh, he became the top-scorer in the
    history of T20 World Cup.Test records
